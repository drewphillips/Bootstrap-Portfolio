    <p>My background is in media production but I donâ€™t get to do much of that these days, I started working in sales and marketing
        in 2011 with a few projects of my own and transitioned in to working for a printing and graphic design company based
        in Phoenix. We started doing full service web design and marketing for a few clients and that lead to us getting
        a hosting reseller account with one of the big name hosting companies. After finding customer service difficult to
        deal with my partners and I purchased our own hardware in a world class data center and began to build out our own
        hosting service. With web development in such high demand it made since to go back to school and become proficient
        in HTML/CSS and other coding languages that my partners have been working with for years. In my personal time I enjoy
        playing pool, Chess, riding a bike, and spending time with friends and family.</p>
